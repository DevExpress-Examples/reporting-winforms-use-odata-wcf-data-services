# How to Use OData (WCF Data Services) as the Report Data Source

This example gets data from the OData service with the [DataServiceQuery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.services.client.dataservicequery) as `IEnumerable<T>`. The report is bound to data through the [ObjectDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.ObjectBinding.ObjectDataSource) component.
